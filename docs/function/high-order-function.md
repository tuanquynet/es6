# High Order Function


## Higher-order functions are nothing more than functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result

```javascript
function comparator(x, y) {
    return x > y ? 1 : -1;
}

[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9].sort(comparator);
```
<!-- js-console -->

## Example of return functions as their result
TBC
